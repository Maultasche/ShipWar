# Ship War

This variation on a popular game is one of the projects I'm working on to better know Node.js.

## Current Status

I've finished the development plan and some initial documents. The next step is to turn the development plan and initial product backlog into Github projects, milestones, and issues.

## Documentation

- [Rules](docs/rules.md)
- [Development Plan](docs/developmentplan.md)
- [Technology Decisions](docs/technologies.md)
- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md)
- [Product Backlog](docs/productBacklog.md)

## Running the Tests

1. Install the dependencies with "yarn install".
2. Run "yarn test" to run the unit tests
